The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's\n    user-agent to the authorization endpoint.  The client includes\n    its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a\n    redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the\n    user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).\n\nB.  The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via\n    the user-agent) and establishes whether the resource owner\n    grants or denies the client's access request.\n\nC.  Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization\n    server redirects the user-agent back to the client using the\n    redirection URI provided earlier (in the request or during\n    client registration).  The redirection URI includes an\n    authorization code and any local state provided by the client\n    earlier.\n\nD.  The client requests an access token from the authorization\n    server's token endpoint by including the authorization code\n    received in the previous step.  When making the request, the\n    client authenticates with the authorization server.  The client\n    includes the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization\n    code for verification.\n\nE.  The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the\n    authorization code, and ensures that the redirection URI\n    received matches the URI used to redirect the client in\n    step (C).  If valid, the authorization server responds back with\n    an access token and, optionally, a refresh token.\n"
